# Project Background

Partnering with a local crowdsourced delivery platform which connects customers who need items delivered with delivery partners. The platform aims to solve the last-mile delivery problem - known to be disproportionately costly.

The main objective of the project is to enable delivery partners to fulfil more jobs in shorter period of time by optimizing the front-end mobile application and introducing a job recommendation algorithm.

# Project Scope

The team of six aims to develop an app design framework integrated with effective front-end and back-end systems. The front-end application development is led by a design thinking approach to enable delivery partners to quickly browse and accept jobs most relevant to them by including features like advanced filters and a geographical view of available jobs. The back-end system will be an integrated solution running in the cloud which adopts a recommendation system (Traveling Salesman Problem with Precedence Constraints or TSP-PC) as well as certain business rules to suggests new jobs to the delivery partners.
